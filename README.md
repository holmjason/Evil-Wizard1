I have created a fun game of beat the old wizard.
Choose among different characters with differnet abilities
Some abilities do random damage.
Have fun beating the wizard as a mage, warrior, archer, paladin, or rogue.
I really like doing this project and having free range on some abilities.
I had some issues with coming up with different fun attacks.
